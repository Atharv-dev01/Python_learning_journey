# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## ✅ Topics Learned:
- Printing output using `print()`
- Using strings, numbers, and mathematical expressions
- Declaring variables
  - String: `name = "Atharv"`
  - Integer: `age = 20`
  - Float: `price = 25.8`

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Python uses dynamic typing
- Data types include: `int`, `float`, `str`, 'bool', 'None'
- You can print multiple values with commas
- Clean formatting improves readability

## ⚠️ Mistakes I Made:
- Forgot proper spacing or indentation
- Confused `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)

## 💡 Learning Tip:
Focus on concepts, not just copying code — understand what each line does.
