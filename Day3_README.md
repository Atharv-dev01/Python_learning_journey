# 📅 Python Learning Journey – Day 3

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Lists
- List Operations (append, extend, pop, insert, remove, sort, reverse)
- List Slicing
- Tuples
- Tuple Slicing
- Tuple Methods (count, index)
- Tuple Arithmetic (concatenation, repetition)

## 📘 What I Learned Today

### 🔹 Lists
- Lists are mutable and can store elements of different data types.
- I learned how to:
  - Access list elements by index
  - Modify lists
  - Add elements using `append()` and `extend()`
  - Use slicing and negative indexing
  - Sort and reverse lists

### 🔸 Mini Project
- 📽️ Created a list to store 3 user-input movie names using `append()`.

### 🔹 Tuples
- Tuples are like lists but immutable.
- I practiced:
  - Indexing and slicing tuples
  - Using `count()` and `index()` methods
  - Combining tuples with `+` and repeating with `*`

---

## 🧪 Key Learning
- Difference between `append()` and `extend()` in lists.
- Lists vs Tuples: mutability and use-cases.
- Efficient use of slicing in both lists and tuples.
- Hands-on mini coding projects helped reinforce concepts.

## 💡 Reflection
Today was a big step forward! I now understand and can use one of the most important data structures in Python: Lists and Tuples. Getting more confident every day 😄
