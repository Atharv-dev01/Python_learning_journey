# Python Learning Journey 🐍

It's pleasure seeing you to my Python learning repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my day to day progression ,practiced codes, and notes as I learn Python from scratch level. 

## 📅 What’s Inside?

- **Day-wise folders** with:
  - Practice Python code (`.py` files)
  - Notes (`notes.md`) in markdown format

## ✅ Current Progress

- 📘 Learning source: [Apna College - Python (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ)
- 🔥 Concepts learned so far:
  - Variables & Data Types
  - Print Statements
  - Input from Users
  - Basic Conditions (`if`, `else`, `elif`) [will be uploaded as new repository in upcoming Github days.]
  - Type casting
  - Comments in Python

## 🎯 Goal

To master Python as my first programming language and build logic, solve problems, and eventually move toward C++ with DSA for FAANG-level preparation.

## 💻 Project Examples
